## ROV – Remotely Operated Vehicle

### OVERVIEW
- This project implements basic control for an ROV

- Uses Arduino for motor and sensor control

- Uses Python for serial communication

-Designed for academic and learning purposes


### TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Arduino

- Python

- Serial communication


### REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
- ROV_arduino.ino

- ROV_python.py

- README.md

### HOW IT WORKS
- Arduino controls motors and sensors

- Python sends commands over serial

- Arduino executes received commands


### SETUP AND USAGE
